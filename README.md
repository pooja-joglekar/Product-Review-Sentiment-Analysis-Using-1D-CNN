# Product-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-1D-CNN
This project is a deep learning-based web application that classifies product reviews as positive or negative using a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN). The model is trained on labelled text data and deployed with a Flask backend and Bootstrap 5 + JavaScript frontend for real-time sentiment prediction.
